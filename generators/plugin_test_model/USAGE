Description:
    Stubs out a new model. Pass the plugin name, model name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    This generates a model class in test/app_root/app/models, a test fixture in
    test/fixtures/singular_name.yml, and a migration in test/app_root/db/migrate.

Examples:
    `./script/generate plugin_test_model has_comments post`

        creates an Post model, fixture, and migration:
            Model:      test/app_root/app/models/post.rb
            Fixtures:   test/fixtures/posts.yml
            Migration:  test/app_root/db/migrate/XXX_add_posts.rb
