Description:
    Stubs out a new database migration. Pass the plugin name, migration name
    (either CamelCased or under_scored), and an optional list of attribute pairs
    as arguments.

    A migration class is generated in test/app_root/db/migrate prefixed by a
    timestamp of the current date and time.

Example:
    `./script/generate plugin_test_migration has_comments AddPosts`

    If the current date is May 14, 2008 and the current time 09:09:12, this creates the AddPosts migration
    db/migrate/20080514090912_add_posts.rb
