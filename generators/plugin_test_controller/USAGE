Description:
    Stubs out a new controller and its views within a plugin. Pass the plugin name,
    controller name (either CamelCased or under_scored) and a list of views as arguments.

    This generates a controller class in app_root/app/controllers and view
    templates in app_root/app/views/controller_name.

Example:
    `./script/generate plugin_test_controller has_comments Posts index show`

    Post controller with URLs like /posts/index.
        Controller: app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
        Views:      app/views/posts/index.html.erb [...]
