== Description

+Description:
+
+The testing_for_plugin generator creates stubs for testing a plugin, as described in http://www.pluginaweek.org/2006/11/24
+
+The generator takes a plugin name as its only argument and creates several files that can be used as scaffolding for tests for the plugin.
+
+With a nod to test-first development, you can run this for a plugin that doesn't yet exist ;)
+
+Example:
+  $ script/generate testing_for_plugin acts_as_most_popular
+  
+  This will create several stub files, something like:
+      
+  $ script/generate testing_for_plugin acts_as_most_popular
+        create  vendor/plugins/acts_as_most_popular/test/railsroot/
+        create  vendor/plugins/acts_as_most_popular/test/railsroot/app/controllers
+         [ ... ] 
+        create  vendor/plugins/acts_as_most_popular/test/railsroot/config/boot.rb
+        create  vendor/plugins/acts_as_most_popular/test/railsroot/config/routes.rb
